# 2. Setup and Configuration

This section covers the deployment and configuration of the virtualised cloud environment used for the MitC attack simulation. It presents the setup clearly and practically, with commands, tool usage, and evidence placeholders.

---

## 🔧 Tools and Platforms Used
- **Proxmox VE** (primary hypervisor)
- **VirtualBox** (initial prototyping)
- **Zentyal Server** (Identity and Access Management)
- **Nextcloud** (token-based cloud storage)
- **Windows 10 Client**
- **Kali Linux / Parrot OS** (attacker VM)
- **TurnKey Linux ISO images**
- **PowerShell** (hypervisor troubleshooting)

---

## 📝 Summary
The project began with VirtualBox-based prototyping, then migrated to Proxmox for stability and realism. Zentyal and Nextcloud were deployed using TurnKey Linux images, with Windows and Kali used for client and attacker roles. The environment included intentional vulnerabilities supporting the MitC attack chain.

# 📌 2.1 VirtualBox Prototype Environment

### Purpose
Create an initial proof-of-concept architecture to test network communication and service interactions.

### Machines Deployed
- Windows 10 Client  
- Attacker VM  
- Early cloud server prototype  

### Issues Encountered
- Network instability.  
- VM freezing under load.  
- Limited realism for cloud workflows.
