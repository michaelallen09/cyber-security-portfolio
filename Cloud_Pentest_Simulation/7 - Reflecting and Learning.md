# 7. Reflection and Learning

This project provided practical, end-to-end experience across cloud security design, offensive testing, detection, and defensive remediation.

## Technical Development

Skills strengthened include:

- Nested virtualisation and lab architecture
- IAM integration and troubleshooting
- SMB exploitation and credential attacks
- Post-exploitation tooling (Mimikatz, Meterpreter)
- Token-based authentication abuse (MitC)
- IDS monitoring and rule evaluation
- Defensive hardening and re-testing

## Key Lessons

- Weak credentials remain a primary attack vector.
- Token-based authentication can enable full cloud compromise if poorly protected.
- Detection without enforcement does not prevent breach.
- Security controls must be validated through re-testing.

This project reinforced my interest in security operations and defensive cloud security, while strengthening practical skills aligned with SOC and security engineering roles.
