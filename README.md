## Introduction
BSc (Hons) Cyber Security graduate with over five years’ experience in IT infrastructure and operations, progressively focusing on security operations, threat detection, identity management, and both defensive and offensive security.

This repository showcases hands-on lab projects including attack simulation, detection testing, log investigation, and mitigation exercises across cloud and virtualised environments.

Focused on developing practical capability in incident response and defensive security engineering.

## Featured Project  
# **Cloud Security: Man-in-the-Cloud (MitC) Attack Simulation**

My final-year cyber security project demonstrates practical offensive exploitation, detection validation, and structured mitigation through a full cloud attack simulation and remediation cycle.

### **Project Highlights**
- Built a nested virtualised lab (VirtualBox → Proxmox VE) hosting Zentyal IAM, Nextcloud, Windows 10, Kali Linux, and Snort IDS/IPS.
- Simulated a full Man-in-the-Cloud (MitC) attack, including token capture and API-based data exfiltration
- Evaluated defensive controls using IDS/IPS and log monitoring
- Performed a complete risk assessment, implemented security mitigations, and re-tested the environment
- Demonstrated both offensive techniques and defensive hardening
